This is a Face-Mesh web application, which maps the points on the user's face using the webcam feed and draws a mesh, which tracks the movement of the user's face.
This happens in three steps:
1. The webcam feed and canvas are set up.
2. The program uses tensorflow libraries to detect the points on the user's face using a detect function.
3. The points and the traingles formed are then drawn onto the canvas.
